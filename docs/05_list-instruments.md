# List Instruments

The list instruments method is used to fetch the list of trade-able instruments of a platform, for example, spot markets. A clearinghouse or liquidity provider can call the exchange with this method to get a list of all supported instruments before sending any limit or quote.

Example of "**list_instruments**" request:

```
[1,42,"list_instruments",["spot", "active"]
```

In response, the method sends information about requested instruments. Each instrument is described with three arguments.
