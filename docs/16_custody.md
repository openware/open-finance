# Custody

## What is Custody?

In our project, we allow user to connect their Metamask wallet onto our platform, providing them a more secure environment for their assets. Users can then deposit funds onto the custody wallet. This deposit to the custody wallet will then open a state channel off-chain. By following nitro protocols on the state channel, we can then have instant finality to user balances after each transaction. This allows the user to have locked balances and make partial/full withdrawals from the custody wallet, back to the Metamask.
