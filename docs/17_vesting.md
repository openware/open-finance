## Vesting


Vesting smart contract allows to grand investors their tokens gradually during some period of time.
Before vesting starts, an admin must verify that Vesting smart contract has enough tokens on vesting token (ERC20) balance.
Tokens can be claimed whenever convenient, though new tokens are released once per specified *Claiming interval*. Thus, there would be no available tokens right after previous claiming.
Vesting process is linear, meaning that for equal periods of time investors will receive equal amount of tokens (except for vesting cliff).
During *Vesting cliff* no tokens are released. E.g. for 10 days vesting cliff, investors can receive their tokens on 11th day.
*Initial Unlock (IU) tokens* are tokens granted to investors right after cliff date.
*Claiming interval* is a time frequency when users can claim their tokens. If interval is equal 30 days, new tokens will be released and available for claiming every 30 days after cliff date.

To deploy a contract one need to specify address of ERC20 token, which will be vested, vesting start (seconds since epoch time),
vesting period (in days), vesting cliff (in days) and claiming interval (in days).
To add an investor an admin must specify their address, vesting token amount and percentage of IU tokens of that amount.

NOTE: Investors can be added only before vesting starts.
NOTE: Contract is upgradeable to ensure if any security issues are found, they can be patched right away.
